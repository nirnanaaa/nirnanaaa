              I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
              difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
              single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it
              through with our various launch simulations.

              I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features
              everyone else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text
