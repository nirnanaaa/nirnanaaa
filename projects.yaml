      - Develop a headless (automated) saltstack-based command execution engine in go, which can run commands on remote servers securely.
      - With custom-built go tooling, a bare-metal kubernetes cluster could be deployed in under 2 minutes compared to the previous time of 30 minutes when using kubespray. The kubernetes components are deployed in an existing kubernetes cluster, once per sub-cluster.
      - Design and configure runtime security software for intrusion- and attack vector detection during the runtime of a linux process within kubernetes.

    invertedSortingWeight: 2
    key_points:
      - Built kubernetes custom resources and controllers in go, which offer a single, standardized interface for metrics, alerts, automatic scaling and user-facing communication endpoints for internal developers. This decreased the deployment time from an average of 15 minutes to a mere 3 minutes and unrecoverable deployment failures, from an average of 1% to below 0.1%.
      - Built automatic backup and restore pipelines for 5 clusters using velero. By building a custom UI, this process wraps the velero custom resources and allows for services to be moved across clusters in under 1 minute, well within the 1 hour RTO.
      - During the process of an organizational carve-out, that I participated in - 150 services (of the back then 600 services) were moved - without downtime - into new organizational structures. Services were including relational databases, AWS account resources, kubernetes controllers and service deployment resources.
