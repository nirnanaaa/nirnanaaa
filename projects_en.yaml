    invertedSortingWeight: 1
    key_points:
    - By implementing unix level automation, on premise and on AWS, we were able to reduce the downtime during incidents and improve the deployment time of all company owned servers.
    - By changing the deployment method from manually provisioned servers and infrastructure to industry best practices (Infrastructure as Code - via CDK) I was able to increase the reliability and boost team confidence when deploying code changes
    - By implementing a CI/CD deployment system on GitHub Actions we were able to reduce the amount of interactions that admins had to go through during deployment
    - By introducing the company to containerized architecture (i.e. Kubernetes or more precise EKS) and deployments, we could reduce the time to deploy and deploy applications in isolation. Deployment times changed from around 30min for a full EC2 instance rebuild to less than 2min.

    shortSummary: Company-wide hosting platform for microservices and AWS account migration
    invertedSortingWeight: 1
    key_points:
      - Built kubernetes custom resources and controllers in go, which offer a single, standardized interface for metrics, alerts, automatic scaling and user-facing communication endpoints for internal developers. This decreased the deployment time from an average of 15 minutes to a mere 3 minutes and unrecoverable deployment failures, from an average of 1% to below 0.1%.
      - Built automatic backup and restore pipelines for 5 clusters using velero. By building a custom UI, this process wraps the velero custom resources and allows for services to be moved across clusters in under 1 minute, well within the 1 hour RTO.
      - During the process of an organizational carve-out, that I participated in - 150 services (of the back then 600 services) were moved - without downtime - into new organizational structures. Services were including relational databases, AWS account resources, kubernetes controllers and service deployment resources.
