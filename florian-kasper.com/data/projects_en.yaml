introduction: |
  Freelance software engineer and platform architect since 2015, focused on Go, Kubernetes and AWS.
  I build distributed systems, internal platforms and automation tooling — typically in environments with hundreds of developers and thousands of services.
  Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend development and infrastructure: custom Kubernetes controllers, CI/CD pipelines, cloud migrations and developer tooling.
  I care about keeping things simple, reliable and easy to operate.
